Tasks for lesson 23 (L23.1)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions




==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======

Learning goals:
reset
HEAD

5. Surprise! The usual routine... as usual... IN CLONE OF ORIGINAL REPOSITORY

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull


6. Switch to your branch and merge master_sara into your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git status
git log -n3
git merge master_sara
git status
git log -n3


7. Was that a good idea? Perhaps not... Let's go back...

git reset HEAD~
git status
git log -n3
git diff

8. Actually... perhaps it was a good idea after all...

git merge master_sara 
git status
git log -n3
git diff

9. Well, it wasn't

git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD
git status
git log -n3
git diff


10. Sorry, only joking, of course it's a good idea. 

git merge master_sara 
git status
git log -n3
git diff

What is the difference between the two methods of reverting the pull/merge?


11. Because it's time to merge your chaper into the cookbook! Do you have the latest updates in master_sara?

git checkout master_sara
git diff master origin/master
(git pull if there is a difference)

git merge <Your_chapter_name>


12. Push the changes to github

git push origin master_sara
