Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======

Learning goals:
Switching between branches
Inspect remote branch


5. We have seven new branches in the repository now and a lot of delicious recipies to look forward to! Each of you should have one branch locally and a corresponding remote branch. Let's have a look!

List all local branches:
git branch

List all remote branches:
git branch -r

List all braches:
git branch -a

Check the relationship between your local branches and remote branches:
git remote show origin

What information do you find about master and your own branch?


6. Swith to your own branch

git checkout Your_branch_name
git branch

Make a folder with a name that describes your recipes. Add a recipe in a text file in this folder. Then do:

git status

Add your changes, commit with an informative message and push your new recipe to the remote.

First try:
git push origin

What message do you get?

Now, do:

git push origin Your_branch_name
