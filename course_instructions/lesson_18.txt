Tasks for lesson 18 (L18.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Set up a fork
Set up additional remotes

5. The usual update first

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara


6. We have looked at a lot of recipes so far and now it's time to bring out the fork. Go to this repository's Github page (in web browser):

https://github.com/annlew/misu_cookbook

7. Click the fork button
(https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)

You should now have a repository

https://github.com/<your_git_name>/misu_cookbook


8. Make a clone of your new fork, e.g.:

git clone https://github.com/<your_git_name>/misu_cookbook.git <my_cookbook_fork>


9. Go to your local (cloned) fork and check what branches it includes and the relationship to remotes

git remote show origin
git remote -v
git branch -vv


10. Set up a connection to the original repository, i.e. add this as an alternative remote repository

git remote add upstream https://github.com/annlew/misu_cookbook

11. Check your remotes and branches again

git remote show origin
git remote -v
git branch -vv
git remote show upstream
