Tasks for lesson 17 (L17.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Set upstream branch


5. Do the usual routine of updating your chapter branch with updates from master.


git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara


6. Now we will look closer at how the chapter interacts with the remote. First check out your chapter branch and the look at the remotes

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>

git remote show origin

Is your chapter branched configured for git pull? Is it configured for git push?

git branch -vv

Does your chapter branch has a corresponding origin/<Your_chapter_name> associated with is?

7. Make a small change to your chapter branch. Stage, commit and push to remote (N.B exactly as written!)

git push origin

What happened?

8. Set an upstream

git push -u origin <Your_branch_name>

9. Check the remotes again

git remote show origin
git branch -vv

Were there any changes?

10. Push your change again

git push origin

Was the push successfull?
