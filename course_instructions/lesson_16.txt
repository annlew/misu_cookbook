Tasks for lesson 16 (L16.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Merge branches
Delete local branches
Delete remote branches

5.  First, update your branch so that it is up to date with the master branch (master_sara).

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara


6. The experimental recipe was a success, and should now be added to your chaper. Merge the experimental topic branch into the chapter branch

git branch 
git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git diff <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git merge <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git diff <Your_experiment_chapter_name>

7. The experimental topic branch has done its job now. We don't want the repository to be cluttered up by old stale branches, so we will delete the experimental topic branch.

git branch
git branch --delete <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git branch

8. And finally, delete the remote experimental branch:

git remote show origin
git push origin --delete <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git remote show origin
