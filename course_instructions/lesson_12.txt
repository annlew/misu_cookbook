Tasks for lesson 12 (L12.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Check out remote branch

5. Now everyone should have at least one recipe in their chapter branch and it's time to start switch recipes! (If you haven't uploaded a recipe it's time you do this now!)

6. First we update all branches with the updates from the master as in last lesson

git branch

Switch to your branch (if you are not already on the correct branch)

git checkout Your_chapter_name
git branch

git merge master


7. Each one of you should check out someone else's chapter with recipes. I have created a list of issues on Github with assignments for each one of you.

First, check all the local branches:

git branch

Check all branches, both local and remote:

git branch -a

And check the relationship between your local branches and remote branches:

git remote show origin

Now check out the remote chapter branch you have been assigned:

git checkout Chapter_branch_name

And repeat the sequence of commands above:

git branch
git branch -a
git remote show origin

8. If the checkout was succesful, close the issue you have been assigned on Github.

9. Cook something nice using your new recipe collection. Take notes on what modifications you did to the recipe. We will use that for upcoming lessons :)
