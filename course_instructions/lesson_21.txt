Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions





==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======

Learning goals:
Repetition: Update local clones, 
inspect history

5. Surprise! The usual routine... IN CLONE OF ORIGINAL REPOSITORY

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara

6. And update the fork: go to your local fork clone again. Update your clone with latest changes from the ORIGINAL repository (upstream), i.e. not your fork.

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull upstream master_sara


7. Also, update the Risotto branch you worked on previously, from the upstream repository, and check the history 

git checkout Risotto
git log -n10

Can you see your modifications in the log?


8. Now go back to the CLONE OF ORIGINAL REPOSITORY. Switch to your branch:

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara

9. Make some improvements to the pasta_tomatosause.txt, add and commit

git add <changed_file>
git commit -m "Tomato sauce improvements"
