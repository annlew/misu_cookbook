Tasks for lesson 22 (L22.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions




==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======

Learning goals:
Repetition: solving conflicts
reset
HEAD

5. Surprise! The usual routine... IN CLONE OF ORIGINAL REPOSITORY

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

6. Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git status
git log -n3
git pull origin <Your_chapter_name>

This should give you a merge conflict, which you have to solve manually
"Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

7. Check the status again, and check the difference between origin and local

git status
git diff <Your_chapter_name> origin/<Your_chapter_name>

8. Open the file that is different in origin/<Your_chapter_name> and edit manually where you find 

++<<<<<<< HEAD
text
++=======
different text
++>>>>>>> <commit number>

9. Add and commit your changes

git add <changed_file>
git commit -m "Sara resolved a mess"
git status
git log -n3

10. Wait.... Are you really happy with your changes? Let's go back. And think about HEAD again (lesson 8). And HEAD~

git reset HEAD~
git status
git diff
git pull
git log -n3

What happened?

11. Edit your recipe again, add and commit.

git add <changed_file>
git commit -m "Sara rescues recipe"
git status
git diff origin/<changed_file>
git log -n3

Are there any differences left?

git pull
git status
git log -n3

12. Push your rescued recipe to origin
git push origin <Your_chapter_name>


13. Oh dear.... What's next?
