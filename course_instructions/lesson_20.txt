Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======

Learning goals:
Repetition: Update local and remote fork
Pull request

5. Surprise! The usual routine... IN CLONE OF ORIGINAL REPOSITORY

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara

6. And update the fork: go to your local fork clone again. Update your clone with latest changes from the ORIGINAL repository (upstream), i.e. not your fork.

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull upstream master_sara

7. Ok, now it's time to mess with a branch. Check out the branch "Risotto"

git branch
git checkout Risotto
git pull upstream Risotto

8. Make some change to Risotto, add commit

git add <changed files>
git commit -m "Sara added a new delicious Risotto"

9. Check the differences

git diff Risotto upstream/Risotto
git diff Risotto origin/Risotto
git diff upstream/Risotto origin/Risotto

10. Push your changes to your fork

git push origin Risotto

11. Check the differences

git diff Risotto upstream/Risotto
git diff Risotto origin/Risotto
git diff upstream/Risotto origin/Risotto

12. Make a pull request: Go to your fork on GitHub and use the pull request button. More reading e.g. here:
