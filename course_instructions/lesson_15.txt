Tasks for lesson 15 (L15.1)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Managing branches
Stash and pop

5. Your recipe survived the cooking battle and it's time to develop your recipe. First, update your branch so that it is up to date with the master branch (master_sara).

git branch
git checkout master_sara
git pull

Switch to your branch 

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git branch
git merge master_sara

6. Create a "topic branch" based on your chapter branch <Your_chapter_name> where you can experiment with your recipe:

git checkout -b <Your_experiment_chapter_name>

7. Inspect current local and remote branches:

git branch
git branch -vv
git remote show origin

8. Check the history of your experimental recipe branch

git log <Your_experiment_chapter_name> --oneline --decorate --graph

and the full repository

git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

9. Now we start the experiment. Make sure you are on the experimental topic branch:

git branch
git checkout <Your_experiment_chapter_name>

Create a new file with an experimental recipe. Do not add or commit. Check the status:

git status

10. Switch branch:

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git status

What happened?

11. Switch back to experimental topic branch and add and commit your experimental recipe.

git checkout <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git add <experimental_recipe>
git commit -m "<Name> create <experimental_recipe>"

12. Add a new ingredient to your experimental recipe. Do not add or commit.

13. Swithch branch once more

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git status

What happened?

14. Add the changes you made in <experimental_recipe> in <Your_experiment_chapter_name>

git add <experimental_recipe>
git status

15. Swithch branch again:

git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git status

What happened?

16. The experiment is now finished yet, so it's too early to commit. Let's stash the modifications while going back to the original <Your_chapter_name>

git stash
git status
git checkout <Your_chapter_name>
git status

17. Check your stash
git stash list 
git stash show

18. Go back to the experiment and finish up

git checkout <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
git status
git stash pop
git status
git commit -m "<Name> updated <experimental_recipe> from stash"

19. Push your experimental recipe branch to origin

git push origin <Your_experiment_chapter_name>
