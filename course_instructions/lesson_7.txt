Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions

5. In the previous lesson (L6) we inspected Antonios' private notes. It seems that we all agree on whathappened with "antonios_private.txt". This time we will focus on Lina's and Sara's "mistakes". We all created a file "my_mistakes.txt" in L2. My plan was that everyone would unstage this file so that this file would not be included in the next commit (I will have to go back and check if I had another guacamole moment here...). Both Lina and Sara committed "my_mistakes.txt" and thus, committed chages to the same file. Let's look:

git log my_mistakes.txt

git show <Lina's_commit_number>

git show <Sara's_commit_number>

What is the difference between the commits they made? Did Sara overwrite Lina's confession that she continues to do mistakes?


6. Lina was not happy with the guacamole recipe:

git log guacamole_ingredients.txt
git log guacamole_instructions.txt

git show <Lina's_guacamole_commit1>
git show <Lina's_guacamole_commit2>
git show <Anna's_guacamole_commit>

Looks like she is planning a big party. However, I was not planning to share my guacamole with anyone.


7. It's time to tidy up. Antonios should not have to share his private notes with everyone, and we will remove Lina's and Sara's mistakes.

Now, you will get individual assignments. I will post issues on github and assign each task to one of you.

Tasks (NB! individual assignments):

7.1 Remove Antonios' antonios.private.txt from the repository:
    
    git fetch
    git pull
    git rm antonios.private.txt
    git status
    git diff --staged
    git commit -m "an informative description of your commit"
    git push origin master 


7.2 Remove Lina's and Sara's mistakes:

    git fetch
    git pull
    git rm my_mistakes.txt
    git status
    git diff --staged
    git commit -m "an informative description of your commit"
    git push origin master


7.3 Restore the guacamole to the original version. First the ingredients:

    git fetch
    git pull
    git checkout <Anna's_guacamole_commit> guacamole_ingredients.txt
    git status
    git diff --staged
    git commit -m "an informative description of your commit"
    git push origin master

7.4 Then, restore the instructions:

    git fetch
    git pull
    git checkout <Anna's_guacamole_commit> guacamole_instructions.txt
    git status
    git diff --staged
    git commit -m "an informative description of your commit"
    git push origin master


7.5 And finally, bring back antonios_private.txt, but keep it untracked locally:

    git fetch
    git pull
    git log antonios.private.txt
    git checkout e579f25 antonios.private.txt
    git restore --staged antonios.private.txt
    git status


8. Task for everyone:

git fetch
git pull
git log
