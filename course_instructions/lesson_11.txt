Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Repetition branches
Switching between branches
Repetition commit

5. Your branch and master should now be syncronised (i.e. everythin in master also exists in your branch, plus your branch specific changes). I have seen a lot of delicious recepies in GitHub, however, some of you have branches that do not contain any recipies yet. Now everyone will add a recipe to your branch.


Make sure you are on your branch:

git branch

Switch to your branch (if you are not already on the correct branch)

git checkout Your_chapter_name
git branch

6. First let's make sure your branch is up to date with master

git merge master


7. Add a recipe. If you haven't already created a folder for your recipies, do that first.

git status

Add your changes, commit with an informative message and push your new recipe to the remote.

Publish your new recipe:

git push origin Your_branch_name
