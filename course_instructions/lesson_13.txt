Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions

==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Make changes to a specific branch

5. After cooking something nice from your new recipes it's time to make some modifications. Now, everyone should make a change to the recipe in the branch that you downloaded from another participant.

6. First we update all branches with the updates from the master as in last lessons

git branch

Switch to your branch (if you are not already on the correct branch)

git checkout Your_chapter_name
git branch

git merge master


7. Checkout the branch that you will make changes to, i.e. your friend's branch

git checkout <Friends_branch_name>

Make some modification to a recipe, add and commit

git add changed_file
git commit -m "<Your name> made a change to <Friend_name> recipe"

8. Push the modified file to the remote

git push origin <Friends_branch_name>


9. Now check what changes your friend made to your recipe

git checkout <Your_branch>
git fetch
git pull origin <Your_branch>
git log -n 5
