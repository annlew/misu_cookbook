Tasks for lesson 14 (L14.2)
################################

Learning goals:
Repetition
Update repository history from remote
Update repository from remote


1. Check the status of your repository

git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master


2. Download the history from remote repository

git fetch
git status
git diff
git diff master origin/master

Once you see the following message, continue to point 3

   "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)"


3. Update your repository with changes from the remote repository (close this file first)

git pull
git status
git diff master origin/master


4. When you have finished point 3, open this file again for further instructions


==== UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS =======


Learning goals:
Resolve merge conflict

5. Now we will create a merge conflict. Let's begin a cooking battle. We repeat the procedure from last lesson (L13) 

6. First we update all branches with the updates from the master as in last lessons

git branch
git checkout master
git pull

Switch to your branch 

git checkout Your_chapter_name
git branch
git merge master


7. Checkout the branch that you will make changes to, i.e. your friend's branch

git checkout <Friends_branch_name>
git pull

Make some modification to a recipe, add and commit

git add changed_file
git commit -m "<Your name> messed up <Friend_name> recipe"

8. Push the modified file to the remote

git push origin <Friends_branch_name>


9. Here we start the battle. Check what changes your "friend" made to your recipe.

NB DO NOT PULL!

git checkout <Your_branch>
git fetch
git diff <Your_branch> origin/<Your_branch>

if that doesn't work try

git diff <Your_branch>...origin/<Your_branch>

This should tell you what change your friend did, file name and line number.

NB DO NOT PULL!

10. Make your strike: edit whatever you currently have in the file your friend changed, on the same line as your friend's change. Then, commit your change.

git add changed file
git commit -m "<Your name> impriving my recipe"

11. Now pull changes from remote
git pull origin <Your_branch>

12. Oh oh... merge conflict!

13. Resolve merge conflict: Open the file containing the conflict and edit: Remove the change you are not happy with and merge conflict indication
<<<<<<< HEAD            (remove)
friends mods            (remove) 
=======                 (remove) 
your mods
>>>>>>> <commit number> (remove)

close file

git status
git add file
git status
git commit -m "<Your name> solves merge conflict in <Your branch>"
git status

14. Push the correct version to remote

git push origin <Your branch>

15. Phew.....
