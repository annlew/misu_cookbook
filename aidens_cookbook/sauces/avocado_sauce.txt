Sauces: a most important part of any meal
*Salsa de pasilla*

Pasilla chilis are the pride and joy of food from Oaxaca, made in mountainous regions; the chili variety is closely guarded by the local farmers, and no (live) seeds are ever allowed out of the pasilla region to protect the indigenous population who make their livelihood with them. They are grown out on hillsides and then dried over fire. What you get are whole, dried (but not bone dry) chili fruits that smell like raisins and plums, with a tiny bit of smoke, nowhere near as smoky as chipotle. The sauce that you can make from it is deeply fruity and not too spicy (per mass, less spicy than jalape√±os). Here's how I make it:

- 3-4 Pasilla chilis (you can get them at the Ica in Liljeholmen, or order online)
- A few cloves garlic
- One onion, chopped into a few chunks
- Cinnamon
- Oregano (if you can, extra points for Mexican oregano, which you can find in Chilean/
other central/South American shops)
Optional but definitely not necessary:
- One fresh tomato

1) Heat about 4 dl of water to a near boil, and pour it over the chilis in a bowl to rehydrate.
Save the chili water for later

2) If using a tomato, roast it over fire or in the oven until the outside is a bit blackened (this is the way to get a lot of the best flavors in Mexican food: a lot of fire)

3) Once the chilis are reconstituted, heat a pan with a little bit of veggie oil
(not too much, the sauce shouldn't be oily)

4) Fry the onion, garlic, and chilis in this until they get some browning

5) Pour the fried onion, garlic, chilis, and the tomato into a blender/food processor,
along with a good pinch of cinnamon, oregano, and salt

6) Blend it into a sauce, and if it isn't runny enough, add some of the reserved chili water, adjust the salt as needed. Pour this over everything you can, like tacos, beans & rice, burritos,
and all that!
