Quaker lemon pies
--------

A religious sect that migrated to the US from England, the quakers were known for their admirable use of every piece of the ingredient and avoiding waste. Their lemon pie is an exemplary treasure from this kind of cooking: it uses the whole lemon and is packed with citrus flavor, with a balancing bitterness from the shell as in a good English marmalade.

Ingredients:
- 2 large lemons
- 5 dl sugar
- 4 eggs
- 2 krm (1/4 tsp) salt
- 4 tbsp (50 g) butter
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1 pie crust, 25-30 cm in diameter and with enough dough for a lid

1) Zest the lemons completely, and slice them thinly. Toss the lemon slices with the sugar, salt, and zest, and let rest covered at room temperature for a full day.

2) Make a custard using the lemons: melt the butter, beat the eggs until fluffy, and add the butter and flour while whisking to combine evenly. Add in all of the lemon/sugar mixture.

3) Pour the custard into the pie crust and top with the lid.

4) Bake the pie at 225° C for 30 minutes, then slice some vent holes in the top of the lid (I make it look like a lemon to make it a meta-pie). Reduce the temperature to 175° C and bake for another 30 minutes. Let it cool completely before serving in order to keep its shape while cutting and serving.
