Biscotti

This is the best recipe I have found for biscotti; it's really flexible, and it turns out not too hard and crunchy like many biscotti do, but has just the right amount of crunch.

Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 dl sugar
- 3 dl flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- a pinch of salt
- 100 g roughly chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts — whatever you want)

Plus any flavors you'd like; some suggestions:
- saffron (steeped in a splash of vodka to evenly distribute the flavor)
- anise seeds
- orange zest
- chocolate bits

1) Preheat the oven to 180° C.

2) Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Beat the eggs and mix them thoroughly together with the dry ingredients.

3) Add the nuts and flavorings and incorporate them.

4) Spread the dough onto a baking sheet, about 1 cm thick and in the shape of a long rectangle about as wide as you want the biscotti to be long.

5) Bake at 180° C for 20 minutes and remove from the oven. Turn the heat down to 120° C. Slice the biscotti into individual pieces about 2 cm wide and lay them on their edge; return them to the oven for another 40-60 minutes, until dry.

Let them cool and then they are ready! I often like to make a quick caramel (a small amount of butter and a few tablespoons sugar in a pan, and heat until melted) and drizzle it across them after they are cool, maybe with a bit of salt.

Accompany the Biscotti with a hot beverage (Antonios suggestion).
