Ingredients :
1) 6 eggs, beaten
2) 1kg ripped tomatoes, grated
3) 4-5 tbsps olive oil
4) a pinch of sugar
5) 100-150g/ 5 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (optional)
6) salt and pepper

Instructions :
1) Into a large saucepan, add the olive oil and place on high heat. When the olive oil heats up, add the grated tomatoes, a pinch of sugar,season with salt and pepper and stir. In case you use feta cheese, be careful with the salt. As soon as the tomato sauce comes to the boil, turn the heat down to medium and cook for 10-15 minutes, until most of the juices have evaporated.

2) Pour in the beaten eggs and stir with a wooden spoon, so that the ingredients combine. Cook until the eggs are cooked. Feel free to add any kind of herbs you wish, like oregano, basil, mint or fresh dill.

3) Top with the feta cheese and serve, while still warm, with some crusted bread aside.
