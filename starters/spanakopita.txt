Ingredients
baby spinach 500g, chopped
leeks 2, halved lengthways and sliced
olive oil 2 tbsp, plus 3 tbsp to brush the pastry
spring onions a small bunch, sliced
feta 200g block, crumbled
dill a handful, chopped
filo pastry 150g (about 6 sheets)

Method
STEP 1

Put the spinach in a large colander and pour over boiling water to wilt it. Drain and cool, then tip into a clean tea towel and squeeze out as much water as possible.

STEP 2

While the spinach is cooling, use a small frying pan to gently cook the leeks and spring onions in 2 tbsp olive oil with a pinch of salt until they are really soft. Season, then tip into a bowl to cool. Add the spinach, feta and dill, and mix well.

STEP 3

Oil a 20 x 20cm baking tin. Brush 4 of the filo sheets with olive oil and use them to line the tin, leaving some of the pastry overhanging. Tip in the filling then cut the remaining filo sheets in half, brush with oil and drape over the top. Bring in the overhanging edges to seal everything in. Lightly score the top into 4 quarters but donâ€™t cut all the way through the pastry.

STEP 4

Heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake the pie for 30-35 minutes or until deep golden brown. Serve just warm or at room temperature.
