I would like to have one credit point for this GIT course :) 

I would like to learn how to use git easily in practise during my PhD. I know a lot already, technical stuff, but I have not started to use GIT in practise. I know it is a useful tool indeed!

Your instructions in L1 about making a guacamole made no sense at all

Git restore is not working for me, it gives me the line:

git: 'restore' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

I have to use:

git reset HEAD <filename> to unstage a staged file

I found the vimdiff as clearest editor, since I am using vim as an editor myself. I did not try other editors.
