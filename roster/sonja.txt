I would like to have one credit point for this GIT course :) 

I would like to learn how to use git easily in practise during my PhD. I know a lot already, technical stuff, but I have not started to use GIT in practise. I know it is a useful tool indeed!

Feedback

Your instructions in L1 about making a guacamole made no sense at all

Git restore is not working for me, it gives me the line:

git: 'restore' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

I have to use:

git reset HEAD <filename> to unstage a staged file

I found the vimdiff as clearest editor, since I am using vim as an editor myself. I did not try other editors.

Antonios problem:
I think he must have had the old instructions when working with L3, so that he staged and committed the private text file without modifying the .gitignore file. Later on he noticed that he had pushed his private file to the remote repository, and then changed the *private.txt into his repository, but at that point the private file was already in the remote one.
