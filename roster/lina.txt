I would like to claim course credit for this course, thank you!!

I would like to learn more about how to use branches efficient

FEEDBACK:
I do not understand the command git diff master origin/master

GIT RESTORE:
Git restore did not work out for me at first since the command did not exist for my git version, but after installing the lastest version of git, it worked (I think)

ANTONIOS QUESTION:
I think that Antonios forgot to update the instructions, and did not update the 
.gitignore file to contain private files before he pushed his changed to the repository.
