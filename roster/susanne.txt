I would like to get course credit.

Question:
When I added my course credit information to my file and did git diff --staged, why was there a b in front of the file name:
--- /dev/null
+++ b/roster/susanne.txt

Specific topic:
I would like to learn how to go back in time and find code changes that happened a while ago, e.g., to find a mistake and correct it.
