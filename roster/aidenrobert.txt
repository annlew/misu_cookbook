Yes, I would like a course credit!

Git topics wished for:
- How to properly revert a fork back to a prior state before pull request
- How to organize a project with several repos under it

Feedback:
I made a delicious guacamole from the recipe in the MISU cookbook.
I had to force an upgrade to git 2.24.1 in order to get git restore to work.

I'm using meld for now, but I installed Kompare, which works well and has a directory explorer.
Colordiff is nice for command line based comparisons
