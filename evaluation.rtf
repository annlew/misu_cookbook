\f0\fs24 \cf0 a. Have the course covered all the topics you expected?\
Yes, its been a great course!\
\
b. Is there any topic you missed in the course?\
No. It covered all the basics I think I need to continue working with git.\
\
c. Are there any topics that should be given more time?\
No, I think it was a good repetition each time of the most important parts.\
\
d. Any topics that we should spend less time on?\
No :)\
\
e. Is there anyting you feel is a complete mystery out of the topics we have covered?\
No, I might have to return to some parts when I encounter those things again (e.g. the difference in deleting something on local and remote branch).\

Definitely!\
\
g. Other comments? (Not related to time :p)\
Thank you Anna for finishing this course even though most of the people didn\'92t continue working on the repository. I think its been a great course and you have done a great job helping me finishing it :)}
