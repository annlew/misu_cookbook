How to cook this delicious soup?

1. Wash, peel and cut the carrots into pieces. Boil the carrots and let them cook for 5 min. 
2. While cooking, prepair the onion, garlic, chili and ginger (peel (not the chili) and cut in small pieces). Fry the onion together with spiskummin in oil, add the chili and ginger when the onion get some color.
3. After 5 min cooking, add the lentils in the soup. I am not sure with the measures of the ingredients, I use my eyes mostly :D Sorry for that! Let the soup boil easily another 10 minutes. 
4. Add the fried spices (point 2) and the cocoanutmilk into the soup and let it boil for another 15 minutes. 
5. In the end, add some salt and pepper and the juice from a lemon. You decide if the soup is nice enough ;) The carrots should be soft and the lentils well cooked.
6. Take the soup from the pan and mash it with a stick blender. 
7. Enjoy the soup with some nice bread!

Tips: If you make a big portion of this soup, you can freeze it in lunch boxes, and you have soup for lunch whenever you need it!
